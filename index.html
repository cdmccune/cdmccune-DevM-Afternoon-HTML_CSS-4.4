            <p id="aboutInfo">This is Makaela with a leaf in Odessa, Ukraine. This captures her personality well because she is fun,
            playful and adventurous. She was raised in Stafford, Virginia and attended VCU. This is where she was 
            met by a disciple, began to study the bible and became a disciple herself! Not knowing where this decision
            would lead her in life, she went into the ministry after college and after a few years became a missionary
            in Eastern Europe.

            <p id="mediaInfo">If life was a movie, these would be our songs and the video.
                This video was taken when we were in Ã‡irali on the amazing boat playing billionaire
                and these are some songs that we have enjoyed together. Especially when we were first friends, 
                sending music to one another was one of the main ways we connected. When I watch this video and listen
                 to these songs, they remind me of her. We will continue to make more of these memories in our future.
