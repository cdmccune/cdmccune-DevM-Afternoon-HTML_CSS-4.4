            <p id="aboutInfo">This is Makaela with a leaf in Odessa, Ukraine. This captures her personality well because she is fun,
            playful and adventurous. She was raised in Stafford, Virginia and attended VCU. This is where she was 
            met by a disciple, began to study the bible and became a disciple herself! Not knowing where this decision
            would lead her in life, she went into the ministry after college and after a few years became a missionary
            in Eastern Europe.
